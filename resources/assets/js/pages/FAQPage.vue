                    <h4>How long will my service project last?</h4>
                    <p>The length of each service project will vary. We are estimating that many of the projects will last approximately four hours. Please check the website or the project catalog for more specific times of each project.</p>

                <li>
                    <h4>What kinds of projects will be available?</h4>
                    <p>There will be a wide spectrum of service projects that will bless different populations in a variety of ways. Examples of projects include: interacting with elderly individuals in retirement homes, cleaning homes and doing yard work, painting, completing administrative tasks to help local organizations, construction projects, etc. We are also forming a CityServe prayer team. For more information, please contact the CityServe Planning Team.</p>

                    <h4>Do I need any special skills?</h4>
                    <p>There are ways for EVERYONE to serve! Although there are some projects that need specific skills (construction, painting, etc.), there are many where a willingness to serve is the most important pre-requisite. Those requiring special skills will be noted in the project descriptions online and in the project catalog.</p>

                    <h4>What if I will be gone that weekend? Can I still participate in some way?</h4>
                    <p>Serving does not need to end April 9 & 10! Feel free to find a group of people and serve others with a project on a different day. You can also commit to pray that God would be made known in the Centre Region during CityServe weekend. For more information, please contact the CityServe Planning Team.</p>
